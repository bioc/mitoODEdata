Description: This package contains the experimental data (assay annotation, siRNA annotation, time-lapse cell counts) associated to the paper "Dynamical modelling of phenotypes in a genome-wide RNAi live-cell imaging assay" (submitted). The data ultimately come from the Mitocheck assay reported in "Phenotypic profiling of the human genome by time-lapse microscopy reveals cell division genes" (Neumann, Walter et al, Nature 2010).
